<p>Every employer shall, as a condition to applying for and receiving a building permit, show proof and certify to the permit issuer that it has secured compensation for its employees under this chapter as provided in ss. 440.10 and 440.38. Such proof of compensation must be evidenced by a certificate of coverage issued by the carrier, a valid exemption certificate approved by the department, or a copy of the employer’s authority to self-insure and shall be presented, electronically or physically, each time the employer applies for a building permit. As provided in s. 553.79(19), for the purpose of inspection and record retention, site plans or building permits may be maintained at the worksite in the original form or in the form of an electronic copy. These plans and permits must be open to inspection by the building official or a duly authorized representative, as required by the Florida Building Code. As provided in s. 627.413(5), each certificate of coverage must show, on its face, whether or not coverage is secured under the minimum premium provisions of rules adopted by rating organizations licensed pursuant to s. 627.221. The words “minimum premium policy” or equivalent language shall be typed, printed, stamped, or legibly handwritten.</p>
