<p>For a public or private employer to be eligible for receipt of specific identifiable consideration under s. 627.0915 for a workplace safety program in the setting of rates, the employer must have a workplace safety program. At a minimum, the program must include a written safety policy and safety rules, and make provision for safety inspections, preventative maintenance, safety training, first-aid, accident investigation, and necessary recordkeeping. The department may adopt rules for insurers to utilize in determining employer compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>
