<p>REEMPLOYMENT STATUS REVIEWS AND REPORTS.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>When an employee who has suffered an injury compensable under this chapter is unemployed 60 days after the date of injury and is receiving benefits for temporary total disability, temporary partial disability, or wage loss and has not yet been provided medical care coordination and reemployment services voluntarily by the carrier, the carrier must determine whether the employee is likely to return to work and must report its determination to the employee. The report shall include the identification of both the carrier and the employee, the carrier claim number, and any case number assigned by the Office of the Judges of Compensation Claims. The carrier must thereafter determine the reemployment status of the employee at 90-day intervals as long as the employee remains unemployed, is not receiving medical care coordination or reemployment services, and is receiving the benefits specified in this subsection.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>If medical care coordination or reemployment services are voluntarily undertaken within 60 days of the date of injury, such services may continue to be provided as agreed by the employee and the carrier.</p>

<p>REEMPLOYMENT ASSESSMENTS.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The carrier may require the employee to receive a reemployment assessment as it considers appropriate. However, the carrier is encouraged to obtain a reemployment assessment if:</p>
<div class="stat-number">1.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The carrier determines that the employee is at risk of remaining unemployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">2.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The case involves catastrophic or serious injury.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The carrier shall authorize a rehabilitation provider to provide the reemployment assessment. The rehabilitation provider shall conduct its assessment and issue a report to the carrier and the employee within 30 days after the time such assessment is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(c)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>If the rehabilitation provider recommends that the employee receive medical care coordination or reemployment services, the carrier shall advise the employee of the recommendation and determine whether the employee wishes to receive such services. The employee shall have 15 days after the date of receipt of the recommendation in which to agree to accept such services. If the employee elects to receive services, the carrier may refer the employee to a rehabilitation provider for such coordination or services within 15 days of receipt of the assessment report or notice of the employee’s election, whichever is later.</p>

Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 627, the cost of a reemployment assessment and the first $2,500 in reemployment services to an injured employee must not be treated as loss adjustment expense for workers’ compensation ratemaking purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(c)</div>
<div class="stat-text">

<div class="stat-text">
<p>TRAINING AND EDUCATION.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>Upon referral of an injured employee by the carrier, or upon the request of an injured employee, the department shall conduct a training and education screening to determine whether it should refer the employee for a vocational evaluation, approve training and education, or approve other vocational services for the employee. At the time of such referral, the carrier shall provide the department a copy of any reemployment assessment or reemployment plan provided to the carrier by a rehabilitation provider. The department may not approve formal training and education programs unless it determines, after consideration of the reemployment assessment, that the reemployment plan is likely to result in return to suitable gainful employment. The department may expend moneys from the Workers’ Compensation Administration Trust Fund, established by s. 440.50, to secure appropriate training and education at a Florida public college or at a career center established under s. 1001.44, or to secure other vocational services when necessary to satisfy the recommendation of a vocational evaluator. As used in this paragraph, “appropriate training and education” includes securing a high school equivalency diploma, if necessary. The department shall by rule establish training and education standards pertaining to employee eligibility, course curricula and duration, and associated costs. For purposes of this subsection, training and education services may be secured from additional providers if:</p>
<div class="stat-number">1.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The injured employee currently holds an associate degree and requests to earn a bachelor’s degree not offered by a Florida public college located within 50 miles from his or her customary residence;</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">2.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The injured employee’s enrollment in an education or training program in a Florida public college or career center would be significantly delayed; or</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">3.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The most appropriate training and education program is available only through a provider other than a Florida public college or career center or at a Florida public college or career center located more than 50 miles from the injured employee’s customary residence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>When an employee who has attained maximum medical improvement is unable to earn at least 80 percent of the compensation rate and requires training and education to obtain suitable gainful employment, the employer or carrier shall pay the employee additional training and education temporary total compensation benefits while the employee receives such training and education for a period not to exceed 26 weeks, which period may be extended for an additional 26 weeks or less, if such extended period is determined to be necessary and proper by a judge of compensation claims. The benefits provided under this paragraph shall not be in addition to the 104 weeks as specified in s. 440.15(2). However, a carrier or employer is not precluded from voluntarily paying additional temporary total disability compensation beyond that period. If an employee requires temporary residence at or near a facility or an institution providing training and education which is located more than 50 miles away from the employee’s customary residence, the reasonable cost of board, lodging, or travel must be borne by the department from the Workers’ Compensation Administration Trust Fund established by s. 440.50. An employee who refuses to accept training and education that is recommended by the vocational evaluator and considered necessary by the department will forfeit any additional training and education benefits and any additional payment for lost wages under this chapter. The carrier shall notify the injured employee of the availability of training and education benefits as specified in this chapter. The Department of Financial Services shall include information regarding the eligibility for training and education benefits in informational materials specified in ss. 440.207 and 440.40.</p>

<p>PERMANENT DISABILITY.The judge of compensation claims may not adjudicate an injured employee as permanently and totally disabled until or unless the carrier is given the opportunity to provide a reemployment assessment.</p>

<div class="stat-text">
<p>DEPARTMENT CONTRACTS.The department may contract with one or more third parties including, but not limited to, rehabilitation providers, to administer training and education screenings, reemployment assessments, vocational evaluations, and reemployment services authorized under this section. Any person or firm selected by the department may not have a conflict of interest that might affect its ability to independently perform its responsibilities with respect to administering the provisions of this subsection. A rehabilitation provider who contracts with the department to provide screenings or evaluations may not provide training or education to the injured employee.</p>
