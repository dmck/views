At a minimum, the program must include a written safety policy and safety rules, and make provision for safety inspections, preventative maintenance, safety training, first-aid, accident investigation, and necessary recordkeeping. The department may adopt rules for insurers to utilize in determining employer compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>
