</div>
<div class="card-block">
<p>Workers’ compensation adjudications by judges of compensation claims are exempt from chapter 120, and no judge of compensation claims shall be considered an agency or a part thereof. Communications of the result of investigations by the department pursuant to s. 440.185(4) are exempt from chapter 120. In all instances in which the department institutes action to collect a penalty or interest which may be due pursuant to this chapter, the penalty or interest shall be assessed without hearing, and the party against which such penalty or interest is assessed shall be given written notice of such assessment and shall have the right to protest within 20 days of such notice. Upon receipt of a timely notice of protest and after such investigation as may be necessary, the department shall, if it agrees with such protest, notify the protesting party that the assessment has been revoked. If the department does not agree with the protest, it shall refer the matter to the judge of compensation claims for determination pursuant to s. 440.25(2)-(5). Such action of the department is exempt from the provisions of chapter 120.</p>
