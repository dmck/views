<p>If an employee in this state subject to this chapter temporarily leaves the state incidental to his or her employment and receives an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment, the employee is, or the beneficiaries of the employee if the injury results in death are, entitled to the benefits of this chapter as if the employee were injured within this state.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(2)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>An employee from another state and the employer of the employee in the other state are exempt from this chapter while the employee is temporarily in this state doing work for the employer if:</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The employer has furnished workers’ compensation insurance coverage under the workers’ compensation insurance or similar laws of the other state to cover the employee’s employment while in this state;</p>

<div class="stat-text">
<p>The benefits under the workers’ compensation insurance or similar laws of the other state, or other remedies under similar law, are the exclusive remedy against the employer for any injury, whether resulting in death or not, received by the employee while temporarily working for that employer in this state.</p>

<div class="stat-number">(4)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A certificate from the duly authorized officer of the appropriate department of another state certifying that the employer of the other state is insured in that state and has provided extraterritorial coverage insuring employees while working in this state is prima facie evidence that the employer carries that workers’ compensation insurance.</p>

<p>When an employee has a claim under the workers’ compensation law of another state, territory, province, or foreign nation for the same injury or occupational disease as the claim filed in this state, the total amount of compensation paid or awarded under such other workers’ compensation law shall be credited against the compensation due under the Florida Workers’ Compensation Law.</p>
