<p>PROCEDURE IN LIQUIDATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL SELF-INSURER BY COURT.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>

<div class="stat-text">

Such court, whenever circumstances exist deemed by it to require the appointment of a receiver for all the assets in and out of this state, and the business, of a foreign individual self-insurer doing business in this state, in accordance with the ordinary usages of equity, may appoint such a receiver for all its assets in and out of this state, and its business, even though no receiver has been appointed elsewhere. Such receivership shall be converted into an ancillary receivership when deemed appropriate by such circuit court in the light of orders entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in some other state, providing for a receivership of all assets and business of such individual self-insurer.</p>

If the court requires the filing of claims, it shall fix a date, which shall be not less than 4 months from the date of the offer, as the last day for filing of claims, and shall prescribe the notice of the date so fixed that shall be given to creditors and claimants. Prior to the date so fixed, the court may extend the time for the filing of claims. Creditors and claimants failing to file proofs of claim on or before the date so fixed may be barred, by order of court, from participating in the distribution of the assets of the individual self-insurer.

</div>
<div class="stat-number">(c)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The receiver in any proceeding under this section may avoid any transfer of or lien upon the property of an individual self-insurer which any creditor, stockholder, or subscriber of such individual self-insurer might have avoided and may recover the property so transferred unless such person was a bona fide holder for value prior to the date of the entering of an order to show cause under this chapter.

<div class="stat-text">
<p>Every transfer made or suffered and every obligation incurred by an individual self-insurer within 1 year prior to the filing of a successful petition in any delinquency proceeding under this section, upon a showing by the receiver that the same was incurred without fair consideration, or with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either then-existing or future creditors, shall be fraudulent and voidable. However, every such transfer or obligation incurred or suffered within 6 months prior to the filing of the above petition shall be presumed void and fraudulent, with the burden of proof upon the obligee or transferee to show otherwise. This paragraph shall not apply to a person who in good faith is a purchaser, lienor, or obligee, for a present fair equivalent value, but any purchaser, lienor, or obligee who in good faith has given a valuable consideration less than fair for such transfer, lien, or obligation may retain the property, lien, or obligation as a security for repayment. The court may, on due notice, order any such transfer or obligation to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, and in that event the receiver shall succeed to and may enforce the rights of the purchaser, lienor, or obligee.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>Transfers shall be deemed to have been made or suffered, or obligations incurred, when perfected according to the following criteria:</p>
<div class="stat-number">1.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">2.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the individual self-insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">3.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">4.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>Any transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition in a delinquency proceeding shall be deemed to be made immediately before the filing of a successful petition.</p>
</div>
<p>Subparagraphs 1.-4. apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained any liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(c)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The transferor or obligor individual self-insurer shall record and preserve adequate official memoranda by corporate minutes which shall fully reflect all transactions involving transfers as contemplated by this section of real property or securities of any type and, in the case of all other property or assets, any transfer out of the individual self-insurer’s ordinary course of business. Any person, firm, or corporation, or any officer, director, or employee thereof, who violates this paragraph commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or by a fine of not more than $5,000. Each instance of such violation shall be considered a separate offense.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(d)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The personal liability of the officers or directors of an insolvent individual self-insurer is subject to part I of chapter 607 and the penalties provided therein.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(e)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>Every transaction of the individual self-insurer with a reinsurer or an excess insurer within 1 year prior to the filing of the petition shall be voidable upon a showing that such transaction was made without fair consideration or with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either then-existing or future creditors notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1).</p>

<div class="stat-text">
<p>TRANSFERS AFTER PETITION.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>After the original petition is filed in any delinquency proceeding, a transfer of any of the real property of the individual self-insurer made to a person acting in good faith shall be valid against the receiver if made for a present fair equivalent value, or, if not made for a present fair equivalent value, then to the extent of the present consideration actually paid therefor, for which amount the transferee shall have a lien on the property so transferred. The recording of a copy of the petition for, or order in, any delinquency proceeding with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where any real property in question is located is constructive notice of the commencement of a delinquency proceeding. The exercise by a court of the United States or any state with jurisdiction to authorize or effect a judicial sale of real property of the individual self-insurer within any county in any state shall not be impaired by the pendency of such a proceeding unless the copy is recorded in the county prior to the consummation of the judicial sale.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>After the original petition for a delinquency proceeding has been filed and before an order of conservation or liquidation is granted:</p>

<div class="stat-number">2.</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A person indebted to the individual self-insurer or holding property of the individual self-insurer may, if acting in good faith, pay the indebtedness or deliver the property or any part thereof to the individual self-insurer or upon her or his order, with the same effect as if the petition were not pending.</p>

<p>A person asserting the validity of a transfer under this subsection has the burden of proof. Except as elsewhere provided in this subsection, any transfer by or in behalf of the individual self-insurer after the date of filing of the original petition in any delinquency proceeding requesting the appointment of a receiver by any person other than the receiver is not valid against the receiver.</p>
