<p>CREATION OF ASSOCIATION.</p>
<div class="stat-number">(a)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>There is created a nonprofit corporation to be known as the “Florida Self-Insurers Guaranty Association, Incorporated,” hereinafter referred to as “the association.” Upon incorporation of the association, all individual self-insurers as defined in ss. 440.02(24)(a) and 440.38(1)(b), other than individual self-insurers which are public utilities or governmental entities, shall be members of the association as a condition of their authority to individually self-insure in this state. The association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation as established and approved under subsection (5) and shall exercise its powers and duties through a board of directors as established under subsection (2). The association shall have those powers granted or permitted corporations not for profit, as provided in chapter 617. The activities of the association shall be subject to review by the department. The department shall have oversight responsibility as set forth in this section. The association is specifically authorized to enter into agreements with this state to perform specified services.</p>
</div>
<div class="stat-number">(b)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>A member may voluntarily withdraw from the association when the member voluntarily terminates the self-insurance privilege and pays all assessments due to the date of such termination. However, the withdrawing member shall continue to be bound by the provisions of this section relating to the period of his or her membership and any claims charged pursuant thereto. The withdrawing member who is a member on or after January 1, 1991, shall also be required to provide to the association upon withdrawal, and at 12-month intervals thereafter, satisfactory proof, including, if requested by the association, a report of known and potential claims certified by a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, that it continues to meet the standards of s. 440.38(1)(b)1. in relation to claims incurred while the withdrawing member exercised the privilege of self-insurance. Such reporting shall continue until the withdrawing member demonstrates to the association that there is no remaining value to claims incurred while the withdrawing member was self-insured. If a withdrawing member fails or refuses to timely provide an actuarial report to the association, the association may obtain an order from a circuit court requiring the member to produce such a report and ordering any other relief that the court determines appropriate. The association is entitled to recover all reasonable costs and attorney’s fees expended in such proceedings. If during this reporting period the withdrawing member fails to meet the standards of s. 440.38(1)(b)1., the withdrawing member who is a member on or after January 1, 1991, shall thereupon, and at 6-month intervals thereafter, provide to the association the certified opinion of an independent actuary who is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries of the actuarial present value of the determined and estimated future compensation payments of the member for claims incurred while the member was a self-insurer, using a discount rate of 4 percent. With each such opinion, the withdrawing member shall deposit with the association security in an amount equal to the value certified by the actuary and of a type that is acceptable for qualifying security deposits under s. 440.38(1)(b). The withdrawing member shall continue to provide such opinions and to provide such security until such time as the latest opinion shows no remaining value of claims. The association has a cause of action against a withdrawing member, and against any successor of a withdrawing member, who fails to timely provide the required opinion or who fails to maintain the required deposit with the association. The association shall be entitled to recover a judgment in the amount of the actuarial present value of the determined and estimated future compensation payments of the withdrawing member for claims incurred during the time that the withdrawing member exercised the privilege of self-insurance, together with reasonable attorney’s fees. The association is also entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees in any action to compel production of any actuarial report required by this section. For purposes of this section, the successor of a withdrawing member means any person, business entity, or group of persons or business entities, which holds or acquires legal or beneficial title to the majority of the assets or the majority of the shares of the withdrawing member.</p>

<p>BOARD OF DIRECTORS.The board of directors of the association shall consist of nine persons and shall be organized as established in the plan of operation.

<p>Upon creation of the Insolvency Fund pursuant to the provisions of subsection (4), the association is obligated for payment of compensation under this chapter to insolvent members’ employees resulting from incidents and injuries existing prior to the member becoming an insolvent member and from incidents and injuries occurring within 30 days after the member has become an insolvent member, provided the incidents giving rise to claims for compensation under this chapter occur during the year in which such insolvent member is a member of the guaranty fund and was assessable pursuant to the plan of operation, and provided the employee makes timely claim for such payments according to procedures set forth by a court of competent jurisdiction over the delinquency or bankruptcy proceedings of the insolvent member. Such obligation includes only that amount due the injured worker or workers of the insolvent member under this chapter. In no event is the association obligated to a claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent member. The association shall be deemed the insolvent employer for purposes of this chapter to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and, to such extent, shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent employer as if the employer had not become insolvent.

The association shall have no cause of action against the employee of the insolvent member for any sums the association has paid out, except such causes of action as the insolvent member would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent member. In the case of an insolvent member operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims by the association shall not operate to reduce the liability of the insolvent member to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.</p>

<div class="stat-text">
<p>The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent member shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state. The court having jurisdiction shall grant such claims priority against the assets of the insolvent member equal to that to which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this section. The expense of the association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the expenses of the liquidator.</p>

<div class="stat-number">(c)</div>
<div class="stat-text">
<p>The association shall file periodically with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent member statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association, which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent member.</p>

<p>STAY OF PROCEEDINGS; REOPENING OF DEFAULT JUDGMENTS.All proceedings in which an insolvent employer is a party, or is obligated to defend a party, in any court or before any quasi-judicial body or administrative board in this state shall be stayed for up to 6 months, or for such additional period from the date the employer becomes an insolvent member, as is deemed necessary by a court of competent jurisdiction to permit proper defense by the association of all pending causes of action as to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict, or finding based on the default of the insolvent member. The association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the insolvent member, may apply to have such judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that made such judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend against such claim on the merits. If requested by the association, the stay of proceedings may be shortened or waived.</p>
